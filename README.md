## About

You can create your own modules and download other peoples modules right from github into your project. The cli tool will allow updating and managing the different modules.

## Requirements:
> Note these values are what we use lower version are to be used at your own risk

 - node 10 or higher [Get here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
